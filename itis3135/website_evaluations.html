      <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>
          <a href="https://www.parallel.la/" target="_blank">Parallel.la</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast: </strong> The site uses a dark background with
            light text, or vise versa when transitioning, creating strong visual
            contrast. The site also uses bold imagery against light text, which
            makes reading said text visually pleasing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repetition: </strong>The navigational links "About, Work,
            Contact, and Prism" appear multiple times, insisting the idea that
            the home page is used to navigate to these four core areas of the
            site.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Allignment: </strong>There is consistent card stucture
            across the entire page, with all of them being centered for visual
            consistency. The bodies of text are also always left alligned,
            creating clean reading lines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity: </strong>All related content is clearly grouped:
            Professional projects under "Our work" and newsletter content under
            "Our Newsletter".
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngren.net</a></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast: </strong> There is no discernible typographical
            hierarchy. The site uses, what appears to be, the same or very
            similar font sizes throughout that doesn't follow any real pattern.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repetition: </strong>Blue hyperlinks appear everywhere but
            carry no semantic meaning. Further, it seems that even the pictures
            are links, which defeats the purpose of the linked text. Christmas
            graphics also repeat extensively, which makes zero sense since the
            season has passed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Allignment: </strong>There is absolutely zero allignment
            applied anywhere on the page and each individual card's content, the
            image and the text, can appear in any location within the card.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity: </strong>A single product's information is often
            separated: image in one location, what I believe to be the product
            name 3 inches away, price in a third locaiton, and a link to the
            product page randomly somewhere else.
          </li>
